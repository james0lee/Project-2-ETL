# _Project-2-ETL_
================

### Members: James Lee, Angie Bolden, Peter Flores

## _Proposal_: 
------------
###Looking at the sales of vehicles by the type of engine: electric, hybrid and gas, from the time span of before, during and after the COVID Pandemic in the US. By reviewing this data, we hope to then be able to assess; which engine types are considered 'favorable'and during what periods of time, which engines are becoming less popular or more popular and finally to see if we will be able to predict which one engine types will continue to become more favorable.

## _Purpose_: 
------------
###By looking at the trends and sales of the different vehicle types we hope to be able to better predict the future development and sale of engine types, ensuring users having a better idea on which vehicles will have a better value over time.
